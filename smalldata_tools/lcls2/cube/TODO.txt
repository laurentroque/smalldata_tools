- Add detector metadata to h5 (ped, gain, pixel coord, etc)
- Add processing pipeline on the binned data
- Speed-up event screening: without screening ~2x faster
- Processor file for each hutch / experiment type?
- Clean up bash and submission scripts
- Fly scan implementation:
    - Add to specific index in h5
    - datasource callback for destination (kinda done during testing)
- Multidimensional cube:
    - Probably just an extension of the flyscan interface (flatten bins)
- Performance testing.
- Try to use MPI reduce?
